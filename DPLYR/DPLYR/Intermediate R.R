args(sample)


seq(): Generate sequences, by specifying the from, to, and by arguments.
rep(): Replicate elements of vectors and lists.
sort(): Sort a vector in ascending order. Works on numerics, but also on character strings and logicals.
rev(): Reverse the elements in a data structures for which reversal is defined.
str(): Display the structure of any R object.
append(): Merge vectors or lists.
is.*(): Check for the class of an R object.
as.*(): Convert an R object from one class to another.
unlist(): Flatten (possibly embedded) lists to produce a vector.


(sort(social_vec, decreasing = TRUE))

rep(seq(1, 7, by = 2), times = 7)

grepl(), which returns TRUE when a pattern is found in the corresponding character string.
grep(), which returns a vector of indices of the character strings that contains the pattern.

# The emails vector has already been defined for you
emails <- c("john.doe@ivyleague.edu", "education@world.gov", "dalai.lama@peace.org",
            "invalid.edu", "quant@bigdatacollege.edu", "cookie.monster@sesame.tv")

# Use grepl() to match for "edu"
grepl("edu", emails)

# Use grep() to match for "edu", save result to hits
hits <- grep("edu", emails)

# Subset emails using hits
emails[hits]

@, because a valid email must contain an at-sign.
.*, which matches any character (.) zero or more times (*). Both the dot and the asterisk are metacharacters. You can use them to match any character between the at-sign and the ".edu" portion of an email address.
\\.edu$, to match the ".edu" part of the email at the end of the string. The \\ part escapes the dot: it tells R that you want to use the . as an actual character.


# The emails vector has already been defined for you
emails <- c("john.doe@ivyleague.edu", "education@world.gov", "dalai.lama@peace.org",
            "invalid.edu", "quant@bigdatacollege.edu", "cookie.monster@sesame.tv")

# Use grepl() to match for .edu addresses more robustly
grepl("@.*\\.edu$", emails)

# Use grep() to match for .edu addresses more robustly, save result to hits
hits <- grep("@.*\\.edu$", emails)

# Subset emails using hits
emails[hits]

.sub() only replaces the first match, whereas gsub() replaces all matches.

today <- Sys.Date()

%Y: 4-digit year (1982)
%y: 2-digit year (82)
%m: 2-digit month (01)
%d: 2-digit day of the month (13)
%A: weekday (Wednesday)
%a: abbreviated weekday (Wed)
%B: month (January)
%b: abbreviated month (Jan)

as.Date("1982-01-13")
as.Date("Jan-13-82", format = "%b-%d-%y")
as.Date("13 January, 1982", format = "%d %B, %Y")

n addition to creating dates, you can also convert dates to character strings that use a different date notation. For this, you use the format() function. Try the following lines of code:
format(Sys.Date(), format = "Today is a %A!")

Use the function diff() on pizza to calculate the differences between consecutive pizza days.
